The sentences en español son algo complejas , por que los verbos tienen 10 formas de conjugar.

The senteces en ingles son cuadradas puesto que las formas que tenemos para conjugar con verbos son 3.

How many? Three

```textile
am 
is
are
```

so we can associate

```ts
textile
Yo --> i           (am)
tu --> you         are of the singular person
él --> he          (
   --> she         is
   --> it          )
nosotros --> we    (
ustedes  --> you   are of the plural person
ellos    --> they  )
```
